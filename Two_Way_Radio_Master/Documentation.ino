// This sketch is uploaded to an arduino board connected to the observatory PC by a USB cable.
// The arduino communicates with two other arduino boards using the NRF24l01+ transceivers
// modelled on all three boards.
// This skecth requests actions from the arduino shutter board (open, close, status)
// It reuests the azimuth angle and status from the encoder arduino.


//The sketch will eventually be maintaine in github - https://github.com/paulskirk53/Arduino-Master-Radio
